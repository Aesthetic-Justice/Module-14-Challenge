## Description

This fullstack application includes everything needed to run a locally hosted blog website. In addition to hosting the user's own blogposts, the site allows visitors to sign-up and include their own posts and comments. This technology is built using packages such as ExpressJS, Handlebars, MySQL2, Sequelize, and bcrypt. 

## Installation Instructions

Thanks to Node Package Manager, everything required to install and run the application is contained internally. Simply open the terminal and run the command "npm install".

## Usage Information

To use the application, the user must first seed the database using the command "npm run seed". Then, spin-up the locally hosted instance by running the "server.js" file in the main branch using the included command "npm run start". Finally, send requests to the port indicated by readout in the terminal (8080 by default).
